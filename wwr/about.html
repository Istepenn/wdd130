                <div class="history">
                    <p>White water rafting made its Olympic debut at the 1972 Munich Summer Games. The competition
                        featured a men's and women's event in the slalom discipline. Athletes had to navigate a course
                        of gates, demonstrating both precision and speed as they maneuvered through the challenging
                        rapids. This marked a significant milestone for the sport, bringing it to the world stage and
                        further promoting its growth. The addition of white water rafting to the Olympics not only
                        elevated its status but also inspired a new generation of rafters, both competitive and
                        recreational, as they marveled at the skills and techniques displayed by these elite athletes.

                <div class="history">
                    <p>In the mid-20th century, white water rafting evolved from an adventurous pursuit into a
                        commercialized outdoor activity. It gained popularity as people sought thrilling experiences in
                        the great outdoors. One of the early hotspots for this activity was the Snake River in Wyoming,
                        where intrepid explorers navigated the challenging rapids. As interest grew, pioneering
                        companies began offering guided rafting trips on various rivers, with the Salmon River in Idaho
                        and the Arkansas River in Colorado becoming notable destinations. This transformation marked the
                        birth of the white water rafting industry, attracting enthusiasts and adventure seekers from
                        around the world.</p>
